Quick details of week2 IWS1 51302022 project progress

I made the following progress in week 4 (brief summary): *

After building the post, and get_coil_details endpoints last week, I had to make changes to the post endpoint again. While testing add transaction, I noticed that if a user tries to sell one coin, and already has 1 coin in his portfolio, the app is not letting the transaction go through, this was because there were bad entries in the database table transactions generated by older code that was not added or subtracted from total transactions, so although get_coin_details was working as expecting in getting the cumulative total investment in any coin, some bad values generated from previous code was not added to get_coin_details, I removed them. I did this by building one additional endpoint called delete transaction, which I was planning on building anyway. I wanted an endpoint to delete a transaction if the user wishes to, in cases like accidental additions. I realized instead of deleting the transaction in its entirety when a transaction is deleted, I could have a flag called status with 2 options "active", and "deleted". and built an endpoint delete transaction, when clicked on will set the status flag to delete, the user will have to give the transaction id for the delete to happen. And to not consider the deleted transactions, while running the get_coin_details endpoints for total investment value, I am filtering the transactions based on if status= "active" and ignoring deleted transactions, same for the get transactions endpoint. 


the endpoints were tested using Insomnia API Tester

The two endpoints are in server.py file https://github.com/NagarjunaKocharla/5130f2022/blob/main/Kocharla-Nagarjuna-iws1-project-progress/backend/server.py



GitHub link to one thing I am most proud of that I accomplished this week: Why are you most proud of this?

I am super happy about building the api endpoint to delete transactions and fixing the bug mentioned above, where a user was not able to sell 1 coin eventhough he/she has one coin in his total porfolio
